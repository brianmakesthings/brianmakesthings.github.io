# Hello World!

Today I learned that Github Pages is actually served by Jekyll, a static site generator with a built-in blogging capabilities. As such I've decided to put in the effort to actually learn how to use it and eliminate any excuses I have that will stop me from focusing on the writing.

As a developer, one of the biggest things I want to ensure is that I can write code blocks in many languages.

```ruby
puts "Here's a ruby example!"

sig { returns(String) }
def foo
    "bar"
end
```

Next, let's try a Rust example!

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Here's a rust exmaple too!")
}
```

That's all for now! However, I'll probably use this page to test new features on my blog.
