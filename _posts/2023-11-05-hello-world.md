# Hello World!

Today I learned that Github pages is actually served by Jekyll. As such I've decided to put in the effort to actually learn how to use it.

One of the biggest things I want to ensure is that I can write code blocks in many languages

```ruby
puts "Here's a ruby example!"

sig { returns(String) }
def foo
    "bar"
end
```

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Here's a rust exmaple too!")
}
```
